# ML-Collections

My collection of machine learning algorithms written in numpy.


TODO:
1. Supervised Learning
    - Linear regression
        - [ ] Linear regression (Unregularized)
        - [ ] Normal equation
        - [ ] Ridge regression
        - [ ] Lasso regression
        - [ ] Elastic Net
        - [ ] Polynomial regression (Class/function to transform training examples into n degree polynomial features)
    - Logistic regression
        - [ ] Logistic regression
        - [x] Softmax regression    

Interesting things to try:
- Plot graph to prove how some cost functions are convex some are not
